# garage-tracker
Garage-tracker is a full-stack web application for tracking vehicle maintenance.

## Use of AI (Data Generation)

The seed data for the two collections was created in two steps:

**1. Mockaroo.** I used [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/) to generate the raw records as JSON:

- **Vehicles** (`data/vehicles-mockaroo.json`, 300 rows): `make` (Car Make), `model` (Car Model),
  `year`, `currentMileage`, `purchasePrice`, and `status` (a custom list of
  Active / In Repair / Garaged / Sold). No `id` field was added, so MongoDB generates each `_id`.
- **Services** (`data/services-mockaroo.json`, 700 rows): `date` (formatted `YYYY-MM-DD`),
  `serviceType` (custom list), `mileageAtService`, `cost` (2 decimals), `recommendedInterval`,
  `shopName`, `serviceRating` (1–5), and `notes`. The services were generated **without** a
  `vehicleId`, since the link is added in the next step.

**2. Claude.** I then used Claude (Anthropic) to write a Node script (`data/loadServices.js`) that
prepares a test database from those two files. I directed it to:

- Insert the 300 vehicles, then read back their MongoDB `_id`s.
- Give each vehicle a **random 0–5 services**, so some vehicles have no service history.
- Link each service to a vehicle by storing that vehicle's `_id` as the service's `vehicleId`
  (the foreign key). `vehicleId` is stored as a native MongoDB `ObjectId` (the same type as
  `vehicles._id`), so the two collections join directly without any type conversion.
- Clamp each service's `mileageAtService` so it never exceeds the vehicle's `currentMileage`.
- Stop once 700 services are assigned, giving exactly 1000 total documents across both collections.
- Add a unique nickname to each vehicle.

### Representative prompt

```
I have two mockaroo json files, one for vehicles and one for services. write me a node script
that loads them into mongo. insert the vehicles first so they each get an _id, then give each
vehicle a random 0 to 5 services and link them by putting the vehicle's _id as the service's
vehicleId. also make sure a service's mileageAtService isn't higher than the vehicle's
currentMileage. keep going till 700 services are added so both collections add up to 1000 total,
and print how many services each car got.
```

This script is a development convenience for populating a test database; in normal use the database
is filled through the application's frontend.
