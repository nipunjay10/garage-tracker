// db/database.js
// This module is the ONLY place that talks directly to MongoDB.
// The routes never touch the database; they call the methods below
// (getServices, createService, ...) and just shape the HTTP response.
//
// It's built as a "factory": createDatabase() builds an object with the
// methods, then we export ONE shared instance.
//
// Connection style: each method opens its OWN connection with getClient()
// and closes it in a `finally` block when it's done. This keeps every
// method self-contained and easy to read for a beginner project. (A bigger
// app would open one connection at startup and reuse it; we trade a little
// efficiency for simplicity here.)
